My Workflow
As an Android developer, I would like to put under control the developments of an oss sandbox application gathering some practices in a functional application.

In a craftmanship approach I like to work with practices such as industrialization, continuous quality control, functional orientation and fast delivery.

You will find in this repo a some practices and patterns on workflow files that I will detail below.

Submission Category: Phone Friendly
Yaml File / Link to Code
In the project you can find different workflow files :

CI Workflow - Make build, test and quality check
Release Workflow - Deal with release control and deployment
Super-linter Workflow - Check all files with common lint rules
Here is the main Build workflow 👉
name: Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ] # Just in case main was not up to date while merging PR
  pull_request:
    types: [ opened, synchronize ]

In this file you can see 3 main sections :

build-and-test
static-analysis
generate-release-apk
CI workflow chaining

The build-and-test part is in charge of building application (and check for build failure) and running tests, both unit and instrumented. For instrumented it used android-emulator-runner to prepare a device in order to run. At the end a Jacoco task is merging different coverage result and upload them to Codacy

In parallel of this task, static-analysis is running some of android popular linters : ktLint, detekt, Android lint, Spotless

The last task generate-release-apk is waiting for build-and-test to complete and succeed before running then it will try to build an releaseable apk without publish it.

The real publishing task is in the Release Workflow which do the same job but in an other part of the delivery workflow, when a new version-tag is added. You can notice that the workflow deploy the final apk to firebase through firebase-app-distribution task.

Finally the *.apk file is available to Firebase App Distribution
App distribution ready to serve
